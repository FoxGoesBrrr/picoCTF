### [Picker I](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/400)

The challenge asks us to connect to a server using netcat.

After we connect, we can figure out that it is a terminal emulator made in python. So lets run try to get all the commands available.

    print(globals())
    
We will be able to see a function named `win`. Lets call it and check the output.

    0x70 0x69 0x63 0x6f 0x43 0x54 0x46 0x7b 0x34 0x5f 0x64 0x31 0x34 0x6d 0x30 0x6e 0x64 0x5f 0x31 0x6e 0x5f 0x37 0x68 0x33 0x5f 0x72 0x30 0x75 0x67 0x68 0x5f 0x36 0x65 0x30 0x34 0x34 0x34 0x30 0x64 0x7d

This is a hex data. By running it through a translator and getting its ASCII equivalent, we will get the flag.

Flag: `picoCTF{4_d14m0nd_1n_7h3_r0ugh_6e04440d}`
